I wanted to get messages when files were being added to the local
share point. But I didn't want to get one for every file
uploaded. inotify-growl was the result of a few nights of work.

BUGS:

Can't run with the -d (daemonized) option correctly yet.



TODO:

Implement logging.*

Implement a file-based configuration system.

ZeroConf for growl daemon discovery on local networks.
